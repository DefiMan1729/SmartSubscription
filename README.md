# Smart Contract based subscription management 

This project demonstrates a basic Smart Contract that lets merchants to create payment plans and subscribers to subcribe to those plans.
The Smart Contract takes an existing ERC20 token address, which is used for payments.

There is an option to automate the "payup" function using oracle services. 

NOTE: THIS CODE IS NOT TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION. For example I have not checked for blank/invalid address.


Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
